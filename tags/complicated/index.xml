      <description>Complex vs Complicated What determines the difference between a complicated and a complex problem? Is there a difference between the two? Here&amp;rsquo;s my definitions (as they relate to startups):
 Complicated - technologically difficult, but with a clear path to achieving the goal. The technology may make it infeasible at a current point in time, but with iteration on the technology, the goal can be achieved. The litmus test I would use for this is, if I could change out the central piece of technology that this problem is reliant on, and make it behave any way that I imagine, would the problem be mostly eradicated?</description>
